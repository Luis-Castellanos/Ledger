# Vault Product Roadmap

## Product Vision

Vault is a production-grade personal finance app for people who want deeper understanding, ownership, and trust than mainstream finance apps provide.

The long-term product goal is feature parity with Monarch Money, followed by deeper power-user differentiation. See [MONARCH_PARITY.md](./MONARCH_PARITY.md) for the parity capability map.

It should eventually replace Monarch Money for users who care about:

- Owning and auditing their financial data.
- Beautiful, flexible reporting.
- Accurate statement-backed history.
- Household-level finance management.
- Rich categorization and review workflows.
- Long-term planning without guilt-driven budgeting.
- Exportability and portability.

Vault is not a budgeting coach first. It is a financial operating system: record, reconcile, understand, project, and decide.

## Product Principles

1. **Trust beats automation.** Automation is valuable only when the user can inspect, correct, and understand it.
2. **Statements are source material.** Bank sync is convenience; statements, imports, balances, and audit trails provide durable truth.
3. **Reporting is the core product.** Transactions are the raw material. Reports are the payoff.
4. **The ledger must be explainable.** Every derived number should be traceable to accounts, transactions, imports, categories, and rules.
5. **The app should be calm.** No shame, no streaks, no guilt alerts. Surface reality clearly.
6. **Power can be progressive.** Simple flows first; advanced controls available when needed.
7. **Multi-user from the data model up.** Even if v1 starts single-user, households, ownership, roles, and permissions must not be retrofitted later.
8. **Local confidence before integrations.** Manual and file-based workflows should be excellent before Plaid-style sync.

## Target Users

### Primary: Power Personal Finance User

Someone who already uses Monarch, YNAB, Empower, spreadsheets, or custom exports, and wants more depth and control.

Needs:

- Accurate transactions and balances.
- Custom categories and rules.
- Net worth and cashflow reporting.
- Import/export.
- Confidence that data is private and portable.

### Secondary: Household Finance Partner

A spouse, partner, or trusted household member who needs shared visibility without owning every admin decision.

Needs:

- Simple shared dashboards.
- Clear permissions.
- Low-risk collaboration.
- Mobile-friendly review and browsing.

### Future: Self-Hosted / Privacy-Oriented User

A user who wants control over hosting, data, and integrations.

Needs:

- Documented deployment.
- Backup and restore.
- Minimal vendor lock-in.
- Strong secrets and key management.
- A credible path toward operator-blind or operator-minimized data access so the service owner cannot casually inspect personal financial data.

## Product Scope Model

Vault should be planned as a layered product, not a giant feature list.

### Layer 1: Identity and Ownership

- Users
- Households
- Membership roles
- Sessions
- Invitations
- Audit logs

### Layer 2: Financial System of Record

- Institutions
- Accounts
- Transactions
- Categories
- Merchants
- Imports
- Documents
- Balances
- Rules

### Layer 3: Workflow

- Upload/import
- Review queue
- Categorization
- Transfer matching
- Duplicate detection
- Reconciliation
- Export/backup

### Layer 4: Reporting

- Dashboard
- Transactions
- Cashflow
- Net worth
- Category detail
- Merchant detail
- Account detail

### Layer 5: Expansion

- Goals
- Forecasting
- Investments
- Payroll
- Real estate
- Tax prep
- AI-assisted classification
- Bank sync
- Mobile app
- Privacy hardening: field-level encryption, envelope encryption, user-held or split-held keys, and recovery-safe key rotation.

## MVP Definition

The MVP is not "Monarch, but smaller." It is the smallest production-grade finance ledger that earns user trust.

### MVP Must Have

- Secure account creation and login.
- Household/workspace creation.
- Manual accounts.
- CSV import for transactions.
- PDF/document storage only if the parser is ready; otherwise document attachment can be deferred.
- Transaction table with search, filters, sort, edit, and bulk actions.
- Category taxonomy with parent/child categories.
- Merchant normalization and rules.
- Review queue for uncategorized or uncertain transactions.
- Transfer marking.
- Cashflow report.
- Net-worth report.
- Export transactions to CSV.
- Backup/restore strategy.
- Audit log for destructive or financially meaningful actions.
- Demo mode with synthetic data.

### MVP Should Not Include

- Bank sync.
- Full tax engine.
- Real estate module.
- Payroll parser.
- Investment lots/performance.
- AI auto-actions.
- Operator-blind encryption.
- Native mobile app.
- Payments/subscriptions.

Those are valuable, but they belong after the core ledger is durable.

### Post-V1 Privacy Track: Operator-Minimized Data

The hosted product should eventually make normal operator access to user financial data impossible or highly constrained. V1 protects users from each other through authentication, authorization, ledger scoping, and production access controls; it does not yet make data unreadable to the service operator with database access.

Roadmap goals:

- Classify fields by encryption need: transactions, balances, notes, uploaded document metadata, import raw rows, account identifiers, and exports.
- Evaluate field-level encryption for the most sensitive financial fields before bank sync, AI auto-classification, or public beta expansion.
- Use envelope encryption with per-user or per-ledger data keys, with wrapping keys held outside the database.
- Decide whether keys are service-held, user-held, or split-held. User-held keys improve privacy but complicate search, reporting, rules, recovery, mobile access, and background jobs.
- Define recovery behavior before shipping operator-blind encryption. A design that prevents the operator from reading data may also prevent the operator from recovering lost keys.
- Keep exports compatible with encrypted data, including encrypted backup packages or explicit local decryption before export.
- Add an admin-access policy: production support should not require raw database inspection of user financial records.

Exit criteria:

- A written key-management ADR exists.
- Sensitive-field encryption is covered by tests.
- Operational runbooks describe what support can and cannot see.
- Backups, restore, import, export, reporting, and rules still work within the selected privacy model.
