# Vault V1 Product Requirements Document

## Status

Draft for collaboration.

This document defines the first production-grade release of Vault. It is intentionally narrower than the prototype and broader than a toy MVP. The goal is to ship a trustworthy, usable personal finance ledger that can eventually replace Monarch Money without trying to recreate every advanced module in the first release.

## Product Summary

Vault V1 is a secure single-user finance ledger for importing, reviewing, categorizing, reporting, and exporting personal financial transactions.

The product should answer four core questions:

1. What happened in my financial life?
2. Can I trust the data?
3. Where did my money go?
4. What is my current financial position?

V1 should be good enough for one real user to rely on for monthly financial review.

## Target Users

### Primary User: Finance Power User

A user currently using Monarch, spreadsheets, bank exports, or a mix of tools. They care about accuracy, reporting depth, custom categorization, and data ownership.

### Secondary User: Future Household Collaborator

A spouse, partner, or trusted household member who may need shared visibility in a later release. V1 should not ship collaboration, but it should avoid architectural choices that make collaboration impossible later.

## V1 Goals

- Create a production-grade foundation for personal finance.
- Support a full monthly workflow: import, review, categorize, report, export.
- Make every important number traceable to transactions.
- Establish strong auth, authorization, and user data isolation.
- Make the current privacy boundary explicit: V1 protects users from each other, while later releases must reduce or eliminate operator visibility into raw financial data.
- Build the system with migrations, tests, CI, and security gates from day one.
- Preserve the prototype's best product insights without inheriting prototype sprawl.

## V1 Non-Goals

V1 will not include:

- Bank sync.
- Native mobile app.
- Household collaboration.
- Invitations and shared roles.
- AI auto-categorization.
- Tax engine.
- Payroll parser.
- Real estate module.
- Investment performance/lots.
- Double-entry accounting.
- General ledger, journal-entry, or trial-balance workflows.
- Bill negotiation.
- Subscription payments.
- Public marketing site.
- Multi-currency beyond storing a currency code.
- Operator-blind encryption or user-held key management.

These are future roadmap items.

## Privacy Boundary

V1 must isolate each user's ledger from every other user through authentication, server-side authorization, ledger-scoped data access, and production environment controls. That is the release-blocking privacy requirement for the first production foundation.

V1 does not yet make financial data unreadable to the application operator. A database administrator or production operator with sufficient access could still inspect plaintext transactions, balances, imports, notes, and related financial records.

Post-V1, Vault should add a dedicated privacy track for operator-minimized data access:

- Field-level encryption for highly sensitive financial fields.
- Envelope encryption with per-user or per-ledger data keys.
- Key-wrapping outside the primary database.
- A documented choice between service-held, user-held, or split-held keys.
- Recovery, rotation, backup, export, and support workflows that still work under the selected key model.
- Tests proving encrypted fields are not stored in plaintext.

The product should not ship bank sync, AI-assisted categorization, or broader public-beta usage without revisiting this operator-privacy model.

## Product Positioning

Vault V1 is not "budgeting for beginners." It is a high-trust financial ledger.

Vault V1 is also not accounting software. It can borrow accounting discipline around audit trails, reconciliations, controls, and source traceability, but the core user-facing record is still a personal-finance transaction.

Compared with Monarch:

- Less automation in V1.
- Better auditability and source traceability.
- More explicit data ownership.
- More flexible long-term architecture.
- Calmer, less prescriptive UX.

Compared with spreadsheets:

- Better workflow.
- Better reporting.
- Safer collaboration.
- Better import provenance.
- Less manual cleanup over time.

## Core User Journey

1. User creates an account.
2. User creates their personal ledger.
3. User creates accounts.
4. User imports transactions from CSV.
5. User previews import results.
6. User commits import.
7. User reviews uncategorized transactions.
8. User creates merchant/category rules.
9. User marks transfers.
10. User views cashflow and net worth.
11. User exports transactions or backup data.

This is the V1 heartbeat.

- User/ledger-scoped financial data.
- Soft deletion for financial records.
- Audit logging for meaningful writes.
- Import provenance.
- Stable IDs.
- Migrations committed to source control.
- Seed/demo data.

V1 should avoid:

- Relying on implicit ownership through nested joins only.
- Destructive hard deletes for ledger records.
- Client-generated trust decisions.
- Floating point for money.

## Reporting Requirements

Every report must define:

- Included transactions.
- Excluded transactions.
- Date basis.
- Transfer behavior.
- Category grouping behavior.
- Account filter behavior.

Reports must be traceable to transaction filters.

## Performance Requirements

Initial targets:

- App shell route transition feels immediate.
- Transaction list handles at least 25,000 transactions for one ledger.
- Search/filter returns within acceptable interactive range.
- CSV import handles 5,000 rows.
- Core reports load within 2 seconds for typical ledger data.

Exact targets should be benchmarked once v1 data model exists.

## Accessibility Requirements

Minimum:

- Keyboard navigation for review and transaction workflows.
- Visible focus states.
- Screen-reader labels for icon-only controls.
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA.
- Status is not communicated by color alone.

## Analytics and Observability

Track product/system health without exposing sensitive data unnecessarily.

Events/metrics:

- Import started/completed/failed.
- Import row counts.
- Review queue count.
- Export generated.
- Error rate.
- Slow queries.
- Auth failures.

Avoid:

- Sending raw transaction descriptions to third-party analytics.
- Tracking sensitive merchant/account details.

## V1 Acceptance Criteria

V1 is releasable when:

- A user can complete the core monthly workflow end to end.
- Cross-user ledger access tests pass.
- Typecheck, lint, tests, build, secret scan, and migration checks pass in CI.
- Production, preview, and development environments are separated.
- Import preview/commit/rollback works.
- Cashflow and net worth are traceable to source data.
- Export works.
- Audit log captures critical actions.
- Demo mode is safe and synthetic.

## Open Product Decisions

1. Auth provider: managed provider or custom passkey-first? **Decision: Clerk managed auth for V1.**
2. CSV-first only for V1, or include PDF document upload without parsing? **Decision: CSV import only for V1. PDF/document upload and parsing deferred.**
3. Should restore from backup be required for V1, or is export enough? **Decision: V1 requires export and documented backup package generation. Full restore is deferred to V1.1.**
4. Should V1 support household invitations, or model households now and ship single-user first? **Decision: single-user V1. Household collaboration deferred.**
5. Money storage: integer minor units vs Postgres numeric? **Decision: integer minor units using `bigint`, plus currency code.**
6. Split transactions: V1 or V1.1? **Decision: defer split transactions to V1.1. V1 uses one category per transaction.**
7. Transaction rules: merchant-only in V1 or richer rule builder? **Decision: V1 supports merchant-to-category rules only, with exact/contains/starts-with matching and optional account scope.**
8. How opinionated should the default category taxonomy be? **Decision: ship an opinionated but editable default taxonomy copied into each personal ledger.**
9. Should the first release be self-hosted, private beta hosted, or local-only? **Decision: private hosted beta on Vercel + Neon Postgres.**
10. Should demo mode be public, private, or only for development? **Decision: synthetic seed/demo data for development, QA, screenshots, and testing. Public demo deferred.**
11. Should the core transaction model be renamed to `ledger_entries`? **Decision: no. V1 uses `transactions`; Vault is not double-entry accounting software.**

## Recommended V1 Scope Decisions

To keep V1 shippable:

- Ship Clerk managed auth. Vault owns ledger ownership and application authorization; Clerk owns identity, login, recovery, and session hardening.
- Ship single-user V1. Use a personal ledger boundary so future household collaboration can be added deliberately later.
- Ship CSV import first.
- Defer PDF/document upload and parsing until after CSV import, review, reporting, export, and audit logging are solid.
- Use integer minor units for money, stored as `bigint` with a currency code. Format for display through centralized helpers.
- Ship merchant/category rules, not a full advanced rule engine. V1 rule matching supports exact, contains, and starts-with merchant matching, optionally scoped to one account.
- Defer split transactions to V1.1. V1 uses one category per transaction; future splits should use child allocation rows that preserve the parent ledger amount.
- Require export and documented backup package generation in V1. Defer full restore/import-from-backup to V1.1.
- Ship an opinionated but editable default category taxonomy. Copy defaults into each personal ledger at creation time; users can rename, create, archive, reorder, and set flow type.
- Target a private hosted beta for V1 on Vercel + Neon Postgres. Local development and preview environments are required; self-hosting and public beta are deferred until after the core workflow is proven.
- Include synthetic seed/demo data for development, QA, screenshots, and testing. Defer public demo mode.
- Keep the core model named `transactions`. Accounting-flavored terminology should support auditability and reconciliation, not turn Vault into general-ledger software.
