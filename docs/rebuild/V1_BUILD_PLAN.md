# Vault V1 Build Plan

## Status

Draft for collaboration.

This document turns the V1 PRD and V1 data model into an execution plan for a new production-grade repo.

## Build Strategy

V1 should be built as a sequence of thin, verified vertical slices. Each milestone should leave the app more usable and more trustworthy.

Do not start by recreating the prototype screen-for-screen. Start with the system spine:

1. Repo quality gates.
2. Managed auth.
3. Personal ledger ownership boundary.
4. Database schema and migrations.
5. Core ledger CRUD.
6. CSV import preview/commit.
7. Review and rules.
8. Reports.
9. Export and private beta hardening.

## Guiding Rules

- Main branch must always build.
- No production `db:push`; migrations only.
- No feature ships without authorization tests.
- No financial write ships without audit logging.
- No import writes final transactions before preview.
- No public demo in V1.
- No double-entry/general-ledger concepts.
- Keep UI useful and restrained; avoid prototype sprawl.

## Recommended New Repo Setup

Create a new production repo rather than continuing in the prototype repo.

Suggested name options:

- `vault`
- `vault-ledger`
- `gringotts-vault-v2`
- `vault-finance`

Prototype repo remains the reference library.

## Suggested Stack

Application:

- Next.js App Router.
- React.
- TypeScript strict mode.
- Tailwind CSS.

Database:

- Postgres.
- Drizzle ORM.
- Committed SQL migrations.
- Neon Postgres for private beta hosting.

Auth:

- Clerk managed auth.
- Vault-owned `users` and `ledgers` tables.

Testing:

- Vitest for unit and integration tests.
- React Testing Library for component behavior tests.
- Playwright for E2E tests.
- Test database for migration/data-access checks.

CI:

- Install with lockfile.
- Typecheck.
- Lint.
- Unit tests.
- Integration tests.
- Build.
- Secret scan.
- Migration check.

Deployment:

- Vercel app hosting.
- Neon Postgres database.
- Separate local, preview, and production databases/environments.
